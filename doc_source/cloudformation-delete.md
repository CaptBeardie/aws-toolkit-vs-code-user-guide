# Deleting an AWS CloudFormation Stack<a name="cloudformation-delete"></a>

Using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you can delete AWS CloudFormation stacks\.

## Prerequisites<a name="cloudformation-delete-prereq"></a>

\(In addition to those specified in the [Getting Started prerequisites](setup-toolkit.md#setup-prereq)\.\)
+ The AWS credentials that you configured in [Setting Up Your AWS Credentials](setup-credentials.md) must include appropriate read\-write access to the AWS CloudFormation service\. If, in the **AWS Explorer**, under **CloudFormation**, you see a message similar to "Error loading CloudFormation resources", check the permissions attached to those credentials\. Changes that you make to permissions will take a few minutes to affect the **AWS Explorer** in VS Code\.
