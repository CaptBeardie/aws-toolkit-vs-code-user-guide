# AWS Lambda<a name="building-lambda"></a>

The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code provides support for authoring code for AWS Lambda functions that are part of serverless applications\. This section focuses on how you can use features of the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code to deploy serverless applications that contain Lambda functions\.

Lambda is a fully managed compute service that runs your code in response to events generated by custom code or from various AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\), and Amazon Cognito\.

For more information about Lambda, see the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/)\.
