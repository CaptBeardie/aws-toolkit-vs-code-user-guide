# Working with AWS Services<a name="working-with-aws"></a>

The **AWS Explorer** gives you a view of the AWS services that you can work with when using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code\. This section provides information about how to access and use the **AWS Explorer** in VS Code\. It assumes that you've already [installed and configured](getting-started.md) the Toolkit for VS Code on your system\.

Some important points:
+ If the toolkit is installed and conÔ¨Ågured correctly, you should see items in the **AWS Explorer**\. To see the **AWS Explorer**, choose the **AWS** icon in the **Activity bar**\.

  For example:  
![\[AWS Explorer with credentials defined.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/images/aws-explorer-with-cred.png)
+ Certain features require certain AWS permissions\. For example, to see the AWS Lambda functions in your AWS account, the credentials you have configured in [Setting Up Your AWS Credentials](setup-credentials.md) must include at least read\-only Lambda permissions\. See the following topics for more information about the permissions that each feature needs\.
